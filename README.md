# Ansible Tower Installation Example

Steps following the offical [documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/quickinstall/) from Ansible to install Tower.

This setup will only install the prerequisites but not tower itself. When the Vagrant provisioning script finishes there will be a message on how to kick the actual installation off.

To run this, simply punch in `vagrant up` and then follow the prompt.
